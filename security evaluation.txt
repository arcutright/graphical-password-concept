typical password charset: {a-Z, 0-9, !, @, #, $, *, &, ()}
typical password possibilites:
	6 characters:  2^36.78
	8 characters:  2^49.03
	10 characters: 2^61.29

our system's entropy: number of chunks, number of grid positions, number of images
	let's say: 100 chunks, 1000 images per chunk, 5 images chosen in a password, 1000 possible grid positions

	# of possible sets of 5 images in chunk: (1000 p 5) = 2^49.81
	# of possible sets of 5 image positions chosen: 1000 grid positions ^ 5 images = 2^49.83
	100 chunk choices * 2^49.83 * 2^49.81 = 2^106.29


	roughly equivalent to the number of possible passwords of 17 chars
		(26+26+10+8)^17 = 2^104.20
